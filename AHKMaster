; "Application Key" (left of right Ctrl) and pressing some other key. 
; Some of them have a second function activated by holding Shift at the 
; same time. Hopefully you will find some of the useful. Feel free to 
; modify, reuse or share any of this.
;
; AppsKey plus - Result

;                Moving the mouse or typing will turn it back on.
;            E - Opens this script for editing.

;            R - Reloads this script.
;                If the active window is this script, it will be saved first.

;      SHIFT T - Makes the active window opaque again.
;            V - Pastes clipboard contents as plain text (if possible).

::..friday::
Send You will need to know the difference between Friday and a fried egg. It's quite a simple difference, but an important one. Friday comes at the end of the week, whereas a fried egg comes out of a chicken. Like most things, of course, it isn't quite that simple. The fried egg isn't properly a fried egg until it's been put in a frying pan and fried. This is something you wouldn't do to a Friday, of course, though you might do it on a Friday. You can also fry eggs on a Thursday, if you like, or on a cooker. It's all rather complicated, but it makes a kind of sense if you think about it for awhile.
