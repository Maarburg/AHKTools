; This is a random selection of utilities. All are activated by holding 
; "Application Key" (left of right Ctrl) and pressing some other key. 
; Some of them have a second function activated by holding Shift at the 
; same time. Hopefully you will find some of the useful. Feel free to 
; modify, reuse or share any of this.
;
; AppsKey plus - Result
;
;        Enter - Inserts a linebreak.
;                For use when pressing enter would submit a form.

;                For use when pressing tab would change the focus.
;   Arrow Keys - Move the mouse with the arrow keys.
;                For use when you need pixel-precise control.
;       Insert - Searches for the slected text with Google. Or if the text

;                Press both windows keys at once to re-enable them.

;            C - Eject the CD tray.   |Handy if the computer is on the floor
;      SHIFT C - Retract the CD tray. |or otherwise awkward to reach.
;            B   Turns the monitor off, similar to power saving mode.
;                Moving the mouse or typing will turn it back on.
;            E - Opens this script for editing.
;            H - Hides the active window.
;      SHIFT H - Unhide all windows that were hidden this way.
;            L - Launch (run) a script selected in explorer.
;                For use when .ahk is not associated with AutoHotkey.
;            R - Reloads this script.
;                If the active window is this script, it will be saved first.
;            T - Makes the active window 50% transpartent.
;      SHIFT T - Makes the active window opaque again.
;            V - Pastes clipboard contents as plain text (if possible).
;                If you "copy" files, this will paste their paths.
;            W - Wraps text to a specific width. (Default 70).
;      SHIFT W - Undoes the above.
;            X - Shows a custom shutdown menu. Press a letter to select from:

;            / - Do a RegEx replace on selected text.
;            [ - Creates matching BBCode tags. (Applied to selected text)
;            , - Creates matching HTML tags. (Ditto)
;            ; - Comments/Uncomments a block of AutoHotkey code.
; ***Custom scripting goes here ***
;
;            1 - Adds 4 spaces "NVM - DUX" a commonly typed sequence at Tools4ever.

Send You will need to know the difference between Friday and a fried egg. It's quite a simple difference, but an important one. Friday comes at the end of the week, whereas a fried egg comes out of a chicken. Like most things, of course, it isn't quite that simple. The fried egg isn't properly a fried egg until it's been put in a frying pan and fried. This is something you wouldn't do to a Friday, of course, though you might do it on a Friday. You can also fry eggs on a Thursday, if you like, or on a cooker. It's all rather complicated, but it makes a kind of sense if you think about it for awhile.

Send Preferred Business Solutions is a local company with over 20 years of focus on businesses just like yours.  We provide top tier IT services, from simple help desk support to mission critical virtual environments.  {return 2}
Send While technology allows us to do much, much more than we could without it, it's ^icritical^i that we pay close attention to the ^bcomplexity and security vulnerabilites^b these capabilities provide.  Often this is way too difficult for small company or even a smaller Managed Services Provider to keep track of. {return 2}

Send The modern business environment is a mixture of various computer systems and resources, all of which are integral to meeting the needs of the organization.  In order to keep these systems—and the organization—running smoothly, it’s important to ensure that user information across all systems and resources remains consistent.  Many organizations use home-grown tools and custom scripts to accomplish this.  However, these tools and scripts may not be flexible enough to support the complete integration and automation of all systems and resources, leaving some systems to be managed manually.{return}{return}
Send With User Management Resource Administrator (UMRA), the process of systems integration and automation is simplified by using the powerful drag-and-drop actions within the UMRA scripting environment.  This allows for highly customizable and powerful solutions to be rapidly deployed and updated, minimizing the time between planning and execution.  Actions that are bundled with UMRA include, but are not limited to: creating and editing Active Directory user accounts, adding and removing Active Directory group memberships, managing Exchange mailboxes, as well as creating and maintaining directory structures.  UMRA’s flexibility allows it to support any workflow.{return}{return}
Send The advantages that UMRA integration and automation has over manual management are:{return}
Send {tab}*Faster integration of user resources and account information, resulting in quicker ROI{return}
Send {tab}*Scheduled tasks allow you to perform operations outside of business hours (i.e., data and mailbox migrations){return}
Send {tab}*The possibility of human error is minimized by UMRA applying a standard process to all data{return}
Send {tab}*Integration and automation with UMRA frees up IT staff to perform less repetitive duties{return}{return}

Send Hi %name%, {return}{return}
Send I work with districts and schools in your area focusing on Identity and Access Management(IdM) and how it simplifies and streamlines user management. Our solutions ensure that user information is consistent across all systems and resources at the same time greatly reducing the IT workload. Our solutions are used by happy clients with as few as 200 to well over 300,000 user accounts. In fact, we have 5 million user accounts being managed by Tools4ever software. With over 14 years of experience and an amazingly fast ROI, Tools4ever is the market leader.{return}{return}
Send Are you still adding/modifying records manually, or relying on narrowly focused scripts? {return}

Send Manual data entry can still work, but it's far from the best use of the IT staff's time. Narrowly focused "single pain point" scripts may solve an immediate problem, but quickly become a challenge to manage and keep updated. In the long run, these scripts move away from a unifying solution and add to the complexity of the environment.{return}{return}
Send With User Management Resource Administrator (UMRA), the process of systems integration and automation is simplified by using the powerful drag-and-drop actions within the UMRA project environment.  This allows for highly customizable and powerful solutions to be rapidly deployed and updated, minimizing the time between planning and execution.  Actions that are bundled with UMRA include, but are not limited to: creating and editing Active Directory user accounts, adding and removing Active Directory group memberships, managing Exchange mailboxes, as well as creating and maintaining directory structures.  UMRA’s flexibility allows it to support any workflow, and there are over 130 connectors, including Infinite Campus and Skyward, to allow for a rapid solution deployment.{return}{return}
